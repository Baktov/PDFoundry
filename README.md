A PDF viewer module for Foundry VTT, made for developers to integrate with their systems.

The goal of this library is to provide system developers with a easy to use and homogenized source support library to provide high quality source links in-application. I'd like to be able to click "view source" in every system, because finding information in PDFs takes a long time!

## :warning: This module is considered a pre-release! :warning:
