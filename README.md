A PDF viewer module for Foundry VTT, made for developers to integrate with their systems.

The goal of this library is to provide system developers with a easy to use and homogonized source support library to provide high quality source links in-application. I'd like to be able to click "view source" in every system, because finding information in PDFs takes a long time!

## :warning: This module is considered a pre-release! :warning:
- It has placeholder features where core ones should be.
- It has not be thoroughly tested (although it has been unthoroughly tested).
- **It does not contain any user-facing features yet (you require a system that supports it).**

### Integration
- See [Setup & System Integration](https://github.com/Djphoenix719/PDFoundry/wiki/Setup-&-System-Integration) on the wiki.
- Also see [the documentation](https://djphoenix719.github.io/PDFoundry/classes/pdfoundryapi.html).

## Roadmap
